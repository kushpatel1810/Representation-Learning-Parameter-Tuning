# Representation-Learning-Parameter-Tuning

This is a part of my assignment in the course, ECE 657A Data and Knowledge - Modeling and Analysis, affiliated with the University of Waterloo.

Here, Abalone Fish and Wine datasets are analysed as below.

•	Improved model performance using a variety of techniques, such as feature extraction, parameter tuning, and through detailed analysis and visualizations.

•	Applied Principal Component Analysis (PCA) and Linear Discriminant Analysis (LDA) to the “Wine” and “Abalone” datasets, and examined how the new data representations affected 
  interpretability and classification performance.
  
•	Used multiple classifiers, including Naïve Bayes, Decision Tree, Random Forest, and Gradient Boosted Tree, to classify wine quality in the “Wine” dataset and to predict the age 
  of abalone fish based on their rings in the “Abalone” dataset. Compared the accuracy of each classifier.
  
•	Employed grid search cross-validation (gridsearch CV) to optimize the hyperparameters of the Decision Tree and Random Forest classifiers.
